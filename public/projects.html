      is a tabletop inspired steampunk airship tactical strategy game.
      Deep ship/fleet customization, multiplayer, and open-source balance collaboration are built in from the ground up.
      Many technologies and techniques are implemented here to bring together the full game experience.
      This has been my greatest cross-discipline project to date. There is a blog in the site going into more detail,
      but if you ever ask me about how the development is going, I can talk about it for hours on end.

        is an excellent tool used by Adviserly to manage the onboarding of large dealership staff.
        It can be difficult to break down preconcieved stereotypes about dealership sales.
        No one wants to deal with an oily salesman!
        These generated biographies help quickly represent each staff member accurately,
        and can publish to dealer pages quickly due to its
        integration with the Adviserly systems.

      <p>An epic tale told over pixels, 8 years in the making. 
        The <a href="https://RegalArbor.com" target="_blank">closed alpha testing site is here</a> and will have public statistics about the build progress of the game.
        Regal Arbor was originally built in Unity 3D version 2 before sprite layers were supported. Logic was written in unityscript, then converted to C# back in those days.
        Third time is the charm! A more modernized approach with terraform handling IaC <i>(infrastructure as code)</i> gels together the Vue website. 
        PhaserJs 3.0 is the current engine with some new advantages and disadvantages. With the main advantage being project orginization and modern vanilla javascript.

        An evolution in how we've handled historical dms data in house. After a new data source is discovered; that data from N unknown sources runs through a series of rules.
        Failure to meet specification places individual rows to the side. We have at least five dms providers with changing schema (some of which include manual entry).
        This allows alerts to be precise whilst continuing to deliver on the n% good data that always exists in a setting where users hand type information.

        Look, reports aren't fun. Fancy numbers are needed to prove a business is functioning as expected.
        The right numbers communicated at the right time can mean the difference between a churn or a
        continued B2B <i>(business to business)</i> relationship. This reporting pipeline
        was designed to flexibly fragment and chunk portions of our lambda fleet to work through
        customer segments piece by piece. Processing can be replayed for better devEx and troubleshooting.
        A scheduler handles when reports are delivered, and our internal email-api hanldes delivery integrity.
        Finally the reports are published as fixed static sites for greatest portability.

        Anyone whom has worked with the dms provider cdk knows just how much of a snowflake <i>(unique server)</i> cluster they have in the backend.
        I stood up a fault tolerant API interface in front of the CDK API so that our data driven products could be reliably powered by current dealership data.
        Datasets are not prejoined; we have to aqquire auxillary data whilst avoiding race conditions introduced by cdk's server overload and retries.
        Our service translates the xml structure into a more modern json while abstracting the taxing time sensative join complexities. Finishing touches included a chat bot named <i>CDKen</i>.
