# ShonDiaz.com
_I got pretty lucky and snagged the domain for my name. Annoyed that other people have my nam, but what else can I do except take the coveted .com top level domain?_


## System Requirements
- ubuntu 18
- awscli
- terraform `0.12.20`


## Why Svelte?
Originally, this site was vanillaJS; the original web "framework". The past couple of years, I've come to love svelte and have used it to build 5 projects of varying complexity and production use. Svelte is battle hardened AND it is the closest thing to the old school web dev experience I prefer. It makes me enjoy working on the frontend codebases! React is popular and has a larger community, but I dislike the direction they have choosen to take the framework in. Even though I use react professionally in other places, given a choice, it would always be svelte.


## Deploy as static site _(s3 bucket)_
_simply tag a release on this github repo; master branch will be built, then dist code pushed to the prod bucket_

the prod vanity url will be `https://shondiaz.com`
