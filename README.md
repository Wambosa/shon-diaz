# ShonDiaz.com
_I got pretty lucky and snagged the domain for my name. Annoyed that other people have my name, but what else can I do except take the coveted .com top level domain?_


## System Requirements
- ubuntu 18
- awscli
- terraform `0.12.20`


## Why VanillaJs?
When I first learned how to build websites, there were no fancy frameworks to do it. They were built with html, css, and javascript. This simple and plain approach brings a little joy when considering the ole days.


## Deploy as static site _(s3 bucket)_
_simply tag a release on this github repo; master branch will be built, then dist code pushed to the prod bucket_

the prod vanity url will be `https://shondiaz.com`
